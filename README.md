# Project Overview

In this project, we will cover the following key aspects:

1. **IAM User Setup**: Create an IAM user on AWS with the necessary permissions to facilitate deployment and management activities.
2. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Use Terraform and AWS CLI to set up the Jenkins server (EC2 instance) on AWS.
3. **Jenkins Server Configuration**: Install and configure essential tools on the Jenkins server, including Jenkins itself, Docker, Sonarqube, Terraform, Kubectl, AWS CLI, and Trivy.
4. **EKS Cluster Deployment**: Utilize eksctl commands to create an Amazon EKS cluster, a managed Kubernetes service on AWS.
5. **Load Balancer Configuration**: Configure AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) for the EKS cluster.
6. **Amazon ECR Repositories**: Create private repositories for both frontend and backend Docker images on Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
7. **ArgoCD Installation**: Install and set up ArgoCD for continuous delivery and GitOps.
8. **Sonarqube Integration**: Integrate Sonarqube for code quality analysis in the DevSecOps pipeline.
9. **Jenkins Pipelines**: Create Jenkins pipelines for deploying backend and frontend code to the EKS cluster.
10. **Monitoring Setup**: Implement monitoring for the EKS cluster using Helm, Prometheus, and Grafana.
11. **ArgoCD Application Deployment**: Use ArgoCD to deploy the Three-Tier application, including database, backend, frontend, and ingress components.
12. **DNS Configuration**: Configure DNS settings to make the application accessible via custom subdomains.
13. **Data Persistence**: Implement persistent volume and persistent volume claims for database pods to ensure data persistence.
14. **Conclusion and Monitoring**: Conclude the project by summarizing key achievements and monitoring the EKS clusterâ€™s performance using Grafana.
